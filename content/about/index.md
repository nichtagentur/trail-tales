## Who We Are

Trail Tales is a hiking and trekking resource for adventurers of all levels. We cover everything from day hikes in national parks to multi-week expeditions across mountain ranges.

Our content is built on real trail research, up-to-date route information, and practical experience. Every guide includes the details you actually need: difficulty ratings, permit requirements, best seasons, gear lists, and budget breakdowns.

## What We Cover

**Trail Guides** -- In-depth guides to the world's best hiking routes, from Europe's alpine classics to South America's legendary treks. Each guide includes route details, logistics, and planning tips.

**Gear Reviews** -- Honest, practical gear advice. We focus on what works on the trail, not just marketing specs. From boots to backpacks, trekking poles to water filters.

**How-To Guides** -- Practical skills for the trail. Navigation, altitude acclimatization, safety protocols, fitness training, and Leave No Trace principles.

## Our Approach

We believe the best outdoor content is:

- **Accurate** -- current trail conditions, fees, and regulations
- **Practical** -- actionable advice you can use on your next hike
- **Honest** -- real talk about difficulty, not just highlight reels
- **Comprehensive** -- everything from planning to post-hike recovery

## For Beginners and Veterans Alike

Whether you're planning your first overnight hike or your tenth thru-hike, Trail Tales has something for you. We write for real hikers, not just Instagram audiences.

Happy trails.
